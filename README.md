## General Information

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.  The goal for this project was to create an application in React that mimics the pomodoro technique and provides further practice on rendering and state management using React. The application was created with the following steps in mind:
1. Set the focus duration (default to 25 minutes, no less than 5 or more than 60).
2. Set the break duration (default to 5 minutes, no less than 1 or more than 15).
3. When the user clicks the "play" button, the timer starts.
4. When the focus time expires, an alarm plays and then the break timer starts.
5. When the break time expires, the alarm plays again and then the focus timer starts.
